There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Poetry Pal ##
  > Poetry Pal is an assistant that helps you check syllable, rhyme, and meter for various poem forms.

## Summary ##
  > Poetry Pal makes it simple for the beginning poet to get started.  It gives you templates for various forms of poetry (haikus, sonnets, etc.) and checks the lines you type in against the requirements for that poetry form.  It will check that you have the correct number of syllables, that the right words rhyme, and that stress is placed on the appropriate syllables (when required).

## Problem ##
  > Beginning poets can get confused about the requirements of different forms of poetry, as it's always harder to learn something through abstract descriptions than through practice.

## Solution ##
  > Poetry Pal will evaluate and correct an aspiring poet's poem line by line and word by word, giving them detailed feedback on what they're doing wrong (and right) at every step.  This gives them practical and immediate examples of what they need to do to meet poetry rules.

## Quote from You ##
  > "If Poetry Pal can reduce the number of terrible first poems written by even 5%, the world will be a vastly better place for our children." - Christina Holland

## How to Get Started ##
  > Poetry Pal is free and easy to use.  All you need is a web browser.

## Customer Quote ##
  > "I used to think iambic pentameter was the device that Scientologists use in their free tests, but now I'm writing sonnets like a pro!" - a satisfied customer

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Start now with a simple haiku and see how easy poetry can be.
